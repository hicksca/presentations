# [Mosh](https://mosh.mit.edu/)  

---

We've all seen this before:  

  ```
    [user@local] ~ $ ssh user@remote
    [user@remote] ~ $ foo
  ```  

Distracted by cat gif:  

  ```
    [user@remote] ~ $ bar
    [user@remote] ~ $ Write failed: Broken Pipe

# What is Mosh?
(**Mo**ble **Sh**ell)

^  
- Mosh aims to correct some problems that weren't around when ssh was invented in 95
