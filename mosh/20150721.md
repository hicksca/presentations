We've all seen this before:  

  ```
    [user@local] ~ $ ssh user@remote
    [user@remote] ~ $ foo
  ```  

Distracted by cat gif:  

  ```
    [user@remote] ~ $ bar
    [user@remote] ~ $ Write failed: Broken Pipe
  ```

 - As the tagline says:  

  > "Remote terminal application that allows roaming, supports intermittent connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line editing of user keystrokes. "
